I'm **designer** and **developer**. I am new to the development field and still learning! 
I am a graduate architect 📐 (root of my design skills) and a student of tech 🖥️. I aim to bring design and development together in the most **creative** and **fun** ways ⚡   


🌱 I’m currently a Master's student at Istanbul Technical University, Game and Interaction Technologies 🎮

🌱 I’m currently learning and working on my front end development portfolio ✨ and my game design and development skills 💥
